    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
        <p>
            The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear native to Eurasia and North America. It is one of the largest land
            carnivorans, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and
            slightly bigger on average. The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more
            compactly built than females. The pelage ranges from reddish to yellowish-brown, and dark brown to cream in color.
            The only extant bear with a hump formed entirely of muscle on its shoulders, the brown bear uses these muscles, as
            well its large paws to effectively dig through dirt. Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its
            dietary plasticity.
